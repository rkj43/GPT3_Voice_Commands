# GPT3_Voice_Commands
  The project utilizes text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionality to allow users to interact with GPT-3 using natural language.
  Users can speak commands or questions , which are then converted to text and passed to GPT-3 for processing.
  The model generates a response, which is then converted to speech and played back to the user.
  
  To run just download the python file and use the command : python voiceassistant.py
